# FlappyPenguin
Main character penguin have to avoid ice-burg and one famous bird, and collect points, so that set a new records.

It is one of two games produced during the given time at WSU Hackathon in February 2019.
Production time is about 10 hours. I challenged myself to check my skills of coding. A mobile application that mimics the rules and progress of a game called Flappy Bird. There are no plans for commercial use.
